There is global and block scope. 
Any variable declared outside of a function is global scope and is accessible through out created code.
A function that has it’s own scope is only accessible from that function. 
Global variables are to be avoided as much as possible because new functions can be affected by them and 
can cause errors by associating new functions with previous functions meant for a different purpose which 
leads to indeterminate results. Strict mode sets javascript code to send an error message when let or const 
have not been used to declare function, this avoids side effects of global variables. 
A side effect is when a global variable is altered and doesn’t do its designated job anymore which 
doesn’t make sense to the interpreter and throws an error. A pure function is determinate and has no side effects. 
It works correctly and is unaltered.
